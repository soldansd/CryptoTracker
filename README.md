## Technologies Used üåê

- **Swift**: The core programming language used for developing the app.
- **SwiftUI**: Utilized for building the user interface, providing a modern and declarative approach to UI design.
- **CoreData**: Employed for persistent data storage, allowing the app to save and manage portfolio data locally.
- **GCD (Grand Central Dispatch)**: Used for handling asynchronous tasks, ensuring smooth performance and a responsive user experience.
- **URLSession**: Handles network requests to fetch real-time cryptocurrency data from APIs.
- **CoinGecko API**: The app retrieves cryptocurrency data from the CoinGecko API, which provides comprehensive market information.

## Architecture üèóÔ∏è

The app is structured using the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture, which separates the concerns of data management, user interface design, and business logic. This architecture ensures a clear and maintainable codebase, making it easier to manage and scale the application.

### MVVM Breakdown:

- **Model**: Represents the data layer of the app, including data fetched from APIs and CoreData storage.
- **View**: The user interface components built using SwiftUI.
- **ViewModel**: Acts as the intermediary between the Model and View, handling the business logic and preparing data for display.

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/soldansd/CryptoTracker
